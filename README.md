# BinaryFileIO
Created a Java program with two parts. One that converts text file data into a binary file, and another for reading the binary file.  
The program accept the complete data file pathname as a command line argument.  
Implemented an exponential binary search allowing users to locate items by name within the binary file.  
The text file must have a record(line) containing ten fields, string fields at first and last field, and 8 double fields in the middle for the program to run.
